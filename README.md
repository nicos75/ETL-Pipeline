# ETL-Pipeline
The end of the certificate exam deals with creating an ETL pipeline. This project aims to analyze the change in cryptocurrencies' prices for 2 weeks



#Introduction
« You can't stop things like Bitcoin. It will be everywhere, and the world will have to readjust. World governments will have to readjust." —John McAfee
These words from John McAfee raised several interesting points about cryptocurrencies: there are plenty of them in this market as of today, with millions of transactions every day, and #the ripple effect: to make traditional institutions adapt to them.
In such an environment, how can you predict the price of millions of currencies based on many KPIs ?

#Questions to answer through this case
1) During this phase, we aim to connect Snowflake with the business intelligence tool PowerBI and make our data flow automatically amongst these two platforms. With these insights, we will be able to respond to our study of today: 
2) Based on the API on the cryptocurrency platform Binance, we will examine the price variation of 3 specific currencies: BTCFDUSD, BTCUSDT and ETHFDUSD



#Conclusion
The price variation in the price of a currency is not correlated with its volume. 

Binance APIs inform us of the large number of cryptocurrencies in this market 

Based on the API Klines, the features impacting the price of a cryptocurrency are:
price at opening time
volume also regarded as the number of tokens on the market
time of the transaction

The top 3 popular cryptocurrencies, in terms of exchange, are: BTCFDUSD, followed by BTCUSDT and the ETHFDUSD
A currency may have no value in this market, e.g. PEPEUSDT.
The price variation is especially high by the end of the day or at night, in the USA: +3%, at 01:00 AM
